## I. Variable Scope

### I-A. Declaring variables with `var`

- "The scope of a variable declared with `var` is its current execution context, which is either the enclosing function or, for variables declared outside any function, global. If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
- PS: When a function is declared with the `function` keyword, it follows the same scope rules
- "Because `var` variable declarations (and declarations in general) are processed before any code is executed, declaring a variable *anywhere* in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared. This behavior is called "hoisting", as it appears that the variable declaration is moved to the top of the function or global code."

### I-B. Declaring variables with `let` & `const`

- `let` allows you to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the `var` keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. The other difference between `var` and `let` is that the latter is initialized to a value only when a parser evaluates it..." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
- P.S. `const` has the same rules of scope as `let`
- P.P.S. If `let` is used to declare a variable *outside* of a function, method, or class, it ends up in what is called *script scope*, which is a "global-like" scope where it will be visible in other JavaScript files
- "Redeclaring the same variable (with `let`) within the same function or block scope raises a SyntaxError"


### I-C. Declaring variables inside of ES6 Modules

JavaScript code written inside of an ES6 Module is *private* (not visible from outside the module) by *default*. This includes variables & functions declared with `let`, `var`, and `const`, as well as functions declared with the `function` keyword

### I-D. Questions on Variable Scope

- For questions #1 - #9, what will be logged out? 
- If there is an error, write "ERROR" next to the line of code that produces it
- After you have answered all of the questions, test yourself in the debugger to see if you were right
- Assume that all of following code is running in [*strict mode*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)

## II. Immutability

- "The `const` declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const

- After you have answered all of the questions, test yourself in the debugger to see if you were right
- Assume that all of the following code is running in [*strict mode*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)

## III. Writing JavaScript Functions

1) Declare a JavaScript function named `doubleIt` that accepts a number as an argument. This function will double the number and return the result.


2) Now re-write the `doubleIt` function as an ES6 arrow function.

## VI. Some of the answers

```text
**I. Variable Scope**
```

1) ERROR - because both `myNum1` and `myNum2` have been declared inside of `init()`, and are thus *scoped* to that function

2) `0` - because `var` variables are *scoped* to the entire function in which they are declared

3) ERROR - because `let` variables are *scoped* to the *block* in which they are declared

4) `undefined` - because the `var` *declaration* of `myNum` (but NOT the *initialization* of a value) is *hoisted* to the top of the &lt;script> tag (which is the enclosing *scope* in this instance). The `init()` function is then called, which logs out the current value of `myNum`, which is `undefined`

5) ERROR - because a `let` variable is initialized to a value only when a parser evaluates it

6) `5` - because `var` variables are *scoped* to the entire function in which they are declared, thus `i` is visible outside of the `for` block

7) ERROR - `let` variables are scoped to the enclosing block, so `i` here is only visible within the `for` block

8) `Hi there!` - because function *declarations* (where the `function` keyword is used) are *hoisted* to the beginning of the scope, and can thus be used before they appear in code

9) ERROR - because function *expressions* (where we use `var`, `let`, or `const`) are NOT *hoisted* to the beginning of the scope, and thus cannot be used before they are declared

10) Try it in the browser's debugger

11) Try it in the browser's debugger

12) Try it in the browser's debugger

13) We are calling it "block" scope. The debugger says "local", which means `pi` is scoped to the entire function, which is true in this instance. But because `pi` uses a `let` declaration, it's actually *block-scoped* (which just happens to also be the entire function in this instance). We will make sure that any exam questions will be phrased in such a way to not have this ambiguity

14) Try it in the browser's debugger

15) Try it in the browser's debugger
