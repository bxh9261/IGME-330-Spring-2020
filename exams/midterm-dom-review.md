# DOM *Review*

- For the review questions below, assume that all of the code is running in *strict mode*
- In the short answer questions below, you may not use `document.getElementsByTagname()` or `document.getElementById()` etc. Instead, use one of the 2 methods we have been using in class 
- Be sure to study for the exam by reviewing the resources that we suggested --> [midterm-exam-review.md](./midterm-exam-review.md)

1. Given a page that has a &lt;button> with an `id="button1"`, write JS code to attach a click event to the button. When the button is clicked, the function should print "I was clicked"

2. Given a page that has a &lt;select> element with the `id="dropdown1"`, write JS code to attach a change event to the select box. When the chosen dropdown item is changed, your function should print the current value of the dropdown

3. Given a page with a &lt;p> element of `id="score"`, utilize JavaScript to change the visible text of the paragraph to "Score: 100"

4. Loop through the `colors` array and:
    - Create an *unordered* list of the contents of the array
    - Add this list to a &lt;section> of `id="content"` 
    
`let colors=["Red", "Green", "Blue"];`
