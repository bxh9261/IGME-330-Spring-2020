- Drawing State Stack - `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()`
- Commonly used methods for drawing rectangles, ovals, lines, curves, etc:
  - paths
  - stroke
  - fill
- creating linear and radial gradients
- Canvas Transformations & CTM:
  - does the order of transformations matter?
  - what is the "trick" for drawing and rotating shapes around a center point?
- `.globalCompositeOperation`
- Animating via `window.requestAnimationFrame()`

### B. Image Manipulation
- pixel data
- typed arrays
- writing filters (brighten, darken, tint, etc)

### C. Web Audio
- Audio Routing Graph
  - source node
  - destination node
  - analyzer node
  - effect node(s)
- Frequency Data
- Time Domain Data
- JS Typed Arrays

### D. DOM
**A lot of this was covered in our week 1A demo**
- `querySelector(`) & `querySelectorAll()`
- event handlers and listeners
- working with buttons & form fields
- creating HTML:
  - `.innerHTML`
  - `document.createElement()`, `element.appendChild()`, ...
  - string concatenation & ES6 string templates

- variables - `var`, `let`, `const`
- scope - function, block, global, script, module
- "hoisting" - when are variables available when using `var` or `let` or `function`?
- "use strict"
- reference types v. value types
- function declarations
- function expressions
- anonymous functions
- ES6 arrow functions
- looping through arrays
- ES6 Classes
