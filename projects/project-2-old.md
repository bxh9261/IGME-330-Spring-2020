# Project 2 - Audio Visualizer



## III. Documentation
  -  Both team members will individually submit final docs
    - It's a good idea to document things as you are working on the project
    - Consider setting up a google doc right away so that you can posts links and other information there as you are working.
 - Elucidate how you met the 7 categories of requirements, and be specific about any extras you did - i.e. where you went "above and beyond"
 - Discuss what went right and what went wrong. List what features you would have liked to add to the project if you'd had more time/energy
 - Declare any non-course resources (libraries, sounds, images, tutorials, sample code) you utilized, in both your code comments, and in the final documentation of the project. Note: You don't have to document that you used the code I gave you in class.
- Precisely detail the contributions of each partner to the overall project.
- Grade yourself, your partner, and the overall project and justify it. Use a grade of 0-100%.
