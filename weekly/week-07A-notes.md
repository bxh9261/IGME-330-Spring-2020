  - https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-webaudio-20151208/convolution.html 
    - "A convolution reverb can be used to simulate an acoustic space with very high quality. It can also be used as the basis for creating a vast number of unique and interesting special effects. This technique is widely used in modern professional audio and motion picture production, and is an excellent choice to create room effects in a game engine."
