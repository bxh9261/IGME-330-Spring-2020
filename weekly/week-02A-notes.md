# Week 2A - Review and more Canvas

## I. Overview
Today we will: 
- Take a look at the *ScreenSaver* submissions
- Answer any questions from last week
- Talk about *Randomness & Aesthetics*
- Learn a little more about the canvas API
- Refactor and add features to our screen savers

## II. Required Reading & Assignments (*see myCourses for due dates*)
- Shape Viewer HW -> [HW-shape-viewer.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-shape-viewer.md)
- Study Guide-2 -> [HW-SG-2.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-SG-2.md)

## III. Extra Credit Opportunity (*see myCourses for due dates*)
- This is a potential [Project 1 - *Interactive Sandbox*](../projects/project-1.md) "starter":
  - [HW-Random Walker](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-random-walker.md)

## IV. Presentations
- [Randomness and Aesthetics](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/randomness-1.md)
- [Canvas-2 More Canvas](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/canvas-2.md) - drawing rings, polygons, `ctx.arcTo()`, `ctx.lineJoin`, line dashes

## V. Demo
Keep working on your Screen Saver:
- add **Pause** and **Play** buttons, and a checkbox
- create more helper functions

**\*\*We are not going to collect this, but it will really help you on Project 1, so you need to follow along - and here are some challenges for you:\*\***

- add checkboxes to control the production of lines and circles
- create functions named `drawLine()` and `drawCircle()` (similar to `drawRectangle()` from the demo)
- create a `drawRing()` method that accepts an `innerRadius` and an `outerRadius` parameter (among others) and creates a ring like we did in Canvas-2 above.
- add a `linedash` parameter to `drawRectangle()`/`drawLine()`/`drawCircle()`, and utilize it if the developer passes in an array
