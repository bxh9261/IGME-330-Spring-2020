# Week 3A - IIFEs and ES5 Style Libraries 


## I. Overview
- Review [HW-SG-1](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-SG-1.md):
    - look at Smiley submissions
    - Concepts covered - this was mostly a review of what we have been doing in class (which is a good thing!)
- Review Periodic Functions & Phyllotaxis HW:
  - [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md)
    - look at submissions
  - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md) 
    - look at submissions
- [Project 1](../projects/project-1.md) assigned! See dropboxes for due dates

## II. Lecture - the IIFE - "Immediately Invoked Function Expression"


- Let's head right to this page:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE
- ... which has a nice explanation of how an IIFE works, and what it is for, which is primarily:
  - to create a private scope for a module (of code)
  - to avoid "polluting" the browser's global scope
- Used to be called a "Self-executing anonymous function"
- With ES5 in a web browser, the only way to create truly *private* scope is by declaring variables and functions *inside* of an enclosing function


## III. Demo
- Let's go ahead and try out these IIFE examples in the page linked above
  - Example #1 



## IV. Videos

These videos were originally linked to on 2A:

- [Screen Saver With Controls-5 (22:06)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/screen-saver-with-controls-5) - Getting rid of "magic numbers" and using an IIFE ("immediately invoked function expression") to remove our variables and functions from global scope
- [Screen Saver With Controls-6 (15:35)](https://video.rit.edu/Watch/screen-saver-with-controls-6) - Creating an ES5 Style JS Library with an IIFE
