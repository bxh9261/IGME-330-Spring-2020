## IV. Project 2 & Deliverables

[Project 2 - Audio Visualizer](../projects/project-2.md) - **Deliverables:**


1) Due in discussion thread **Thursday 2/20/2020**, start of class:
    - Who is your partner (or are you working solo, which is fine)?
    - If you want to do more of a game project, and take advantage of the ["OR"](../projects/project-2.md#OR) option
2) Due in myCourses dropbox **Thursday 2/27/2020** (week 7), start of class: 
    - a working prototype that goes at least somewhat beyond the AV HW assignments
    - we will look at these in class
    - because this deliverable is due shortly after *HW Audio Visualizer-3*, this dropbox will stay open until **Saturday 2/29 @ 11:59PM** - anything that makes it into the dropbox will be considered properly submitted with no grade penalty
    - there is a -10% deduction from the final project 2 grade if this prototype is not submitted to the dropbox
3) Due in myCourses dropbox class **Thursday 3/5/2020** (week 8), start of class:
    - working prototype #2 - at a bare minimum a "minimum viable product" that shows your main features and idea - and how it goes beyond our HW assignments - to the dropbox
    - there is a -10% deduction from the final project 2 grade if this prototype is not submitted to the dropbox
4) Final Project Submission:
    - because we have a midterm on **Thursday 3/5/2020** (the end of week 8, and right before spring break) - and we want you to have the time to do a good job on both this project and the midterm ...
    - ... the due date of your final version of Project 2 will be AFTER spring break - **Monday March 16th @ 11:59PM** ...
    - ... late submissions will NOT be accepted.
